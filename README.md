# Decentralized Expense Splitter  

A **smart contract** that allows users to create temporary payment groups, deposit funds equally, and collectively approve or reject payment requests. Members can also **add additional funds** if needed before execution.  

## Features ðŸš€  

- âœ… **Temporary Payment Groups** â€“ Users can form a group and deposit equal amounts.  
- âœ… **Shared Wallet Ownership** â€“ Each member has an equal share of the groupâ€™s balance.  
- âœ… **Approval-Based Payments** â€“ All members must approve a payment request before execution.  
- âœ… **Additional Contributions** â€“ Members can add extra funds when a payment request is made.  
- âœ… **Decentralized & Trustless** â€“ No central authority; funds are only moved when everyone agrees.  

## How It Works ðŸ”¥  

1. **Create a Payment Group** â€“ A user creates a temporary payment group and adds members.  
2. **Deposit Funds** â€“ Each member deposits an equal amount into the shared wallet.  
3. **Request a Payment** â€“ Any member can request a payment from the shared wallet.  
4. **Approve or Contribute** â€“ Members must approve the request and can add extra funds if needed.  
5. **Execute Payment** â€“ If all members approve and sufficient funds are available, the payment is processed.  

## Pros ðŸŒŸ
